# no-gather

Resources accumulate (trickle in) over time and women are champions.
Town and city phase upgrades are fast and free.

(a mod for [0ad](https://play0ad.com/))

The starting resource trickle rate is:

    54 wood
    54 food
    6  stone
    16 metal

every five seconds. When you reach P2, each number is multiplied by
1.3. When you reach P3, the multiplier is 1.5. Which means by P3, the
trickle rate is:

    105 wood
    105 wood
    11  stone
    31  metal

every 5 seconds.

Resources can not be gathered, you can only get them by allowing time
to pass and by using traders (and merchant ships if you're playing a
naval map).

When random maps are generated, they will have fewer trees and fewer
stone and metal mines.
